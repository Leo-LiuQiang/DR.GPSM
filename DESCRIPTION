Description: Implements the Balance-based Generalized Propensity Score Matching (BGPSM) framework for estimating average treatment effects (ATE) in observational studies with two or more treatment groups. The package provides tools to: 
    (1) estimate generalized propensity scores (GPS) using multiple modeling options 
    (multinomial logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, or GAM); 
    (2) perform balance-based matching across all treatment levels simultaneously; 
    (3) optionally fit outcome models for doubly-robust bias correction; and 
    (4) visualize GPS distributions. 
    Designed for causal inference with multi-valued treatments, suitable for applications 
    in epidemiology, health services research, and the social sciences.
